This pad is aimed to collect the requirements of a dataset for the OpenWiFiMap (https://openwifimap.net ). 
Based on https://github.com/freifunk/openwifimap-api/issues/13 let's collect minimal and optional objects and a structure.
Having a common data-structure will allow easy querying and upload / update by different clients and (web-)visualizations.

Mandatoray objects
	* Node
		* Name
		* ID (UUID autogenerated)
		* Location (longitude, latitude, height)
		* WiFi:
			* SSID
			* Channel
	* api-revision
	* script (-> different implementations might have flaws or different dialect. We should know the data producer)

Optional objects
	* Contact
		* Name
		* EMail
		* Homepage
	* System
		* OS-Vendor, Version
		* Load, RAM-use
		* uptime
	* Hardware
		* vendor, Model
		* SoC
		* WiFi-chipsets
		* Flash-size, RAM-size
	* Hotspot
		* SSID, Access-type (unencrypted, Splashpage, Registration), Band
		* Clients connected
	* Mesh (maybe rename to "links". that is more precise than mesh)
		* neighbour (node-name, Linkquality [0..100], protocol, srcAddr, destAddr)
		* I'd really like to have the LQ as float between zero and one. Thats easier to calculate with.
	* Uplink
		* yes / no
		* speed
	* Community
		* Name, Homepage
	* optional fields for routing-protocol-information
	* custom-data
		* dataID (custom identifier): any string
